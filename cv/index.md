### F-16 Lead Structural Engineer (2001-2004)<br>Ogden Air Logistics Center, Hill AFB, UT

- Lead depot engineer supporting over 100 critical items used on 3,900 F-16's at 88 bases worldwide
- Responsible for the design and implementation of modifications and repair procedures to reduce maintenance costs, eliminate mission delays and enhance the performance capabilities of the F-16
- Lead F-16 engineer for Aircraft Battle Damage Repair (ABDR) mission; coordinates training activities, mentors trainees and evaluates battle damage repair procedures in ABDR exercises
- Personally designed depot repairs resulted in over 100 F-16 wings and major wing structures returned to service-saved more than $8M

### Non-Destructive Evaluation Program Manager (2006-2007)<br>Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH

- Directs R & D efforts and facilitates transition of novel non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technologies and techniques
- Develops broad research plan for inspection and characterization of new aircraft materials
- Lead engineer for three separate twelve-member teams charged with solving fleet-wide critical fracture issues at fuselage-wing attachment points for C-5, A-10, and KC-135 aircraft
- Initiated $1.5M KC-135 research program to baseline fleet fatigue damage.  Results of teardown evaluation enabled a five-year fleet life extension and $2M annual savings in maintenance costs

### Military Assistant to the Director (2007-2008)<br>Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH

- Oversees diverse processes for 1,200-person, $500M laboratory facilities to include four GSU's
- Prepares/directs briefings, visits, and lab tours for senior-level DOD, industry and foreign dignitaries
- Directed 1st AFRL Wargame Roadshow - Prioritized 150 research programs and $225M Science and technology budget for OSD Title 10 Wargame

### Lead Materials Engineer (2008-2010)<br>Aeronautical Systems Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH

- Wing lead for modernization and technology transition efforts on over 500 mobility aircraft
- Provides expertise on sustainment requirements for over $44.5B in support systems acquisitions
- Lead materials engineer in Bagram AB C-17 crash recovery effort, efforts led to the successful completion of aircraft ferry flight to depot 74 days early - saved $220M jet from scrapping
- Led C-17 man-portable air defense system (MANPAD) survivability test program to reduce engine infrared signature by 75%.  Test results enabled a 42% increase in counter-measure effectiveness
- Led PACAF engine corrosion field evaluation.  Tested and qualified novel engine inlet coating material, resulted in the elimination a 168-hour overhaul
