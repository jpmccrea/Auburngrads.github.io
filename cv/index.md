# Professional Experience - United States Air Force
## F-16 Logistics Management Branch - Ogden Air Logistics Center - Hill AFB, UT 2001 - 2004	
- Lead Engineer - Structures & Composites
    - Lead depot engineer supporting over 100 critical items used on 3,900 F-16's at 88 bases worldwide  
    - Responsible for the design and implementation of modifications and repair procedures to reduce maintenance costs, eliminate mission delays and enhance the performance capabilities of the F-16
    - Lead F-16 engineer for Aircraft Battle Damage Repair (ABDR) mission; coordinates training activities, mentors trainees and evaluates battle damage repair procedures in ABDR exercises
    - Personally designed depot repairs resulted in over 100 F-16 wings and major wing structures returned to service—saved more than $8M  
## Non-Destructive Evaluation Branch - AFRL - WPAFB, OH 2006 - 2007   	
- NDE Program Manager
    - Directs R&D efforts and facilitates transition of novel NDE inspection technologies and techniques
    - Develops broad research plan for inspection and characterization of new aircraft materials
    - Lead engineer for three separate twelve–member teams charged with solving fleet-wide critical fracture issues at fuselage–wing attachment points for C-5, A-10, and KC-135 aircraft
    - Initiated $1.5M KC-135 research program to baseline fleet fatigue damage.  Results of teardown evaluation enabled a five–year fleet life extension and $2M annual savings in maintenance costs
## Materials and Manufacturing Directorate - AFRL - WPAFB, OH 2007 - 2008
- Military Assistant to the Director
    - Oversees diverse processes for 1,200-person, $500M laboratory facilities to include four GSU's
    - Prepares/directs briefings, visits, and lab tours for senior-level DOD, industry and foreign dignitaries
    - Directed 1st AFRL Wargame Roadshow, prioritized 150 research programs and $225M Science and technology budget for OSD Title 10 Wargame
## 516 Aeronautical Systems Wing - Aeronautical Systems Center - WPAFB, OH 2008 - 2010	
- Wing Materials & Process IPT Lead - Collocated AFRL Engineer 
    - Wing lead for modernization and technology transition efforts on over 500 mobility aircraft
    - Provides expertise on sustainment requirements for over $44.5B in support systems acquisitions
    - Lead materials engineer in Bagram AB C-17 crash recovery effort, efforts led to the successful completion of aircraft ferry flight to depot 74 days early--saved $220M jet from scrapping
    - Led C-17 man-portable air defense system (MANPAD) survivability test program to reduce engine infrared signature by 75%.  Test results enabled a 42% increase in counter-measure effectiveness
    - Led PACAF engine corrosion field evaluation.  Tested and qualified novel engine inlet coating material, resulted in the elimination a 168-hour overhaul procedure
