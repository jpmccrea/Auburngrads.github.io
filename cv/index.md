### Ogden Air Logistics Center - Hill AFB, UT (2001-2004)
- __Lead Engineer, Structures & Composites__
    - Lead depot engineer supporting over 100 critical items used on 3,900 F-16's at 88 bases worldwide
    - Responsible for the design and implementation of modifications and repair procedures to reduce maintenance costs, eliminate mission delays and enhance the performance capabilities of the F-16
    - Lead F-16 engineer for Aircraft Battle Damage Repair (ABDR) mission; coordinates training activities, mentors trainees and evaluates battle damage repair procedures in ABDR exercises
    - Personally designed depot repairs resulted in over 100 F-16 wings and major wing structures returned to service-saved more than $8M

### Air Force Research Laboratory - Wright-Patterson AFB, OH (2006-2008)

- __Non-Destructive Evaluation Program Manager__
    - Directs R&D efforts and facilitates transition of novel NDE inspection technologies and techniques
    - Develops broad research plan for inspection and characterization of new aircraft materials
    - Lead engineer for three separate twelve–member teams charged with solving fleet-wide critical fracture issues at fuselage-wing attachment points for C-5, A-10, and KC-135 aircraft
    - Initiated $1.5M KC-135 research program to baseline fleet fatigue damage.  Results of teardown evaluation enabled a five-year fleet life extension and $2M annual savings in maintenance costs

- __Military Assistant to the Director__
    - Oversees diverse processes for 1,200-person, $500M laboratory facilities to include four GSU's
    - Prepares/directs briefings, visits, and lab tours for senior-level DOD, industry and foreign dignitaries
    - Directed 1st AFRL Wargame Roadshow - Prioritized 150 research programs and $225M Science and technology budget for OSD Title 10 Wargame
