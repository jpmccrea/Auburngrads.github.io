I am an Operations Research Analyst at HQ Air Force Materiel Command, Studies and Analyses Division (HQ AFMC/A9) at Wright-Patterson AFB and have performed analytic services to the Air Force via multiple roles since 2003.  I completed my Ph.D. in the Operational Sciences department at the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), which focused on applying advanced analytics to understand and manage indirect cost behavior across the Air Force enterprise.  I received my M.S. in Cost Analytics at AFIT, and attended undergrad at North Dakota State University.
