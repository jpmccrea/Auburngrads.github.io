# [__SENG 585 - Reliability in System Design__](http://seng-585.github.io/winter-2017)

- The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the probabilistic models and statistical methods used by reliability engineers. This first course gives basic definitions and terminology, investigates parametric lifetime models, non-parametric methods, coherent systems analysis. Markov analysis techniques and an introduction to repairable system analysis. Emphasis will be placed on using these mathematical tools to models RAM as a dynamic process, develop test plans, perform graphical and statistical inference, as well as model product improvement the development process.
