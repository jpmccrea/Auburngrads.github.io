This report provides insight and explanation behind the code used to produce the following graphic which is formatted to resemble the illustration provided in Edward Tufte's classic book <u>Visual Display of Quantitative Information</u>, 2^nd^ Ed. *(page 30)*.

#### <font face="serif">Tufte's Image</font>
The original illustration in Tufte's book comes from *The New York Times*, January 4, 2004, A15.  Although the original graphic had two parts; the temperature component, as shown in the below image, and then a precipitation compenent, I chose to only focus on the temperature component since I could not locate historical precipitation data. I should also point out that the original graphic was based on daily high and low temperatures, whereas my graphic is based on daily average temperatures.  This is likely the reason for the different "thickness" in the range bands and also the reason why the original graphic uses range bars for the current year temps and my graphic uses lines.  It is my assumption that the original graphics *"Normal Range"*, which is the center dark band, represents the mean high and mean low temps for each day.  Since I only have the daily average temps, my *"Normal Range"* represents the 95% confidence interval around the historical mean daily average temps *(thats right, it's an average of an average...just lovely! But since we're reflecting the same measurement for a single group and, for the most part, all days have the same number of observations our interpretation is not being skewed.)*

#### <font face="serif">R Packages Utilized</font>
The following packages were used to develop the visualization.

```r
# Preprocessing & summarizing data
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Visualizatin development
library(ggplot2)
```

#### <font face="serif">Getting & Preparing the Data</font>
The data used was obtained from the University of Dayton's [Average Daily Temperature archive](http://academic.udayton.edu/kissock/http/Weather/) website which contains daily average temperatures for 157 U.S. and 167 international cities with data spanning from January 1, 1995 to present.  Individual text files are provided for each city and the raw data represents month, day, year, and average daily temperature (Â°F) and looks like:


```
##   V1 V2   V3   V4
## 1  1  1 1995 39.0
## 2  1  2 1995 19.6
## 3  1  3 1995 20.6
## 4  1  4 1995 11.3
## 5  1  5 1995  6.8
## 6  1  6 1995 23.0
```
